## CI/CD Builds
This project has Azure CI/CD setup to auto build commits on every commit. People who are not keen on building the project themselves, may use the CI/CD to download the built plugin.

## Building  
This project requires an IDE that supports compiling .NET based code (.NET 9.0). Recommended IDE is Visual Studio 2022.

**Regular Builds**  
Regular builds will usually succeed unless there are changes that are incompatible with the NuGet [PKHeX.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PKHeX.Core) package dependency specified in the `.csproj` files of the projects.

- Clone the PokeFilename repository using: `$ git clone https://github.com/architdate/PokeFilename.git`.
- Right-click on the solution and click `Rebuild All`.
- These DLLs should be placed into a `plugins` directory where the PKHeX executable is. You may also combine these DLL files using ILMerge.
   - The compiled DLLs for PokeFilename will be in the `PokeFilename.GUI/bin/Release/net9.0-windows` directory:
     * PokeFilename.GUI.dll
     * PokeFilename.API.dll

## Usage  
To use the plugins:
- Create a folder named `plugins` in the same directory as PKHeX.exe.
- Put the compiled plugins from this project in the `plugins` folder.
